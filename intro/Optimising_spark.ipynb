The first is through configuration files that reside in the `$SPARK_HOME/conf` directory, the second through the Spark Shell, and the third is to specify them directly in the Spark application or on the command line when submitting Spark jobs. \n",

    "Spark is great at running multiple tasks in parallel. Most of this is enabled by how Spark reads data into memory. Spark reads the data into memory in chunks, also called partitions. Each of the partitions is a subset of the data, and the same set of calculations can be performed on each partition in parallel. This also means that each parallel execution (in most cases) can be seen as independent and, thus, can scale out without a fixed limit. The creators of Spark calls this _embarrassingly parallel_.\n",

    "So, partitions have a big influence on the degree of parallelism, since each partition has to be processed by a task that will be scheduled on a thread on a core of the central processing unit (CPU) (this is generally referred to as the executor) on which the Spark application is running. \n",
    "If your CPU has more than one core, which can be hyper threaded, you would want to have at least a couple of partitions to make sure that all the cores are kept busy processing data and are not sitting idle while others are still performing calculations on a part of the data.\n",

This is an expensive operation since you may be transferring data between executors (on the same CPU) or between workers (requiring network transfer cost). These operations may also have disk spill if there is not enough memory to accommodate the additional data being transferred, which is mostly slow, but specifically if you do not have an SSD attached to the processing machines.

Running Spark on a single core machine is like putting a small 1.0cc engine into the body of a Ferrari. You have a very powerful framework but without a lot of horsepower to power its execution. \n",

Allowing Spark to run multiple threads across more than one core will greatly improve its ability to process big data. Additionally, you get the added benefit of reduced network overhead since you are running all of your processing within a single machine. However, you won't have the ability to scale out to the extent you may achieve with larger computational resources, as you only have a limited number of cores on your stand-alone machine. \n",

These clusters can theoretically scale out indefinitely, adding more and more nodes (single CPU machines) as the load/demand for more computational power increases.

In 2017, [Databricks started partnering with one of the largest cloud providers, Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/scenarios/what-is-azure-databricks) to increase their reach, and they have since also partnered with AWS and GCP. \n",

[MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) provides machine learning and data science experiment tracking, as well as complete model life cycle management, and has become one of the leading tools data scientists use in model development. [Koalas](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) delivers a 'friendlier' entry into Spark, providing a Pandas API in Spark. [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is an abstraction that is built on top of the data lake that allows better management of the underlying data, version control, and structured querying. \n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks has evolved to become a complete cloud data platform solution, leveraging the technology developed in Delta Lake to build what Databricks refers to as the lakehouse. The lakehouse is the coming together of the data warehouse and the data lake, or to say it another way, the lakehouse provides a place where you can easily access or move data into your data lake. Delta Lake and the lakehouse connects with your data lake and provides a way to execute analytical queries against semi-structured data in the data lake, without having to transform or move the data into a structured database. \n",

    "To further open up Databricks and the Lakehouse to the community outside of data engineers and scientists, Databricks launched Databricks SQL, which enables business users to perform business intelligence and reporting on data residing in the data lake (using the lakehouse). Databricks SQL allows querying data using standard SQL within the Databricks environment and lets you connect any of the latest dashboarding tools via connectors. "

The best way to achieve this is by spending time tracing a single task through the Spark UI, in other words, launch a task in Spark and then trace it through the various tabs in the Spark UI. Also look at which stages are computationally the most expensive.\n",

    "In this train, we have seen how we can bend Spark to our will by not just using it as it comes out of the box, but rather tuning the application to our very specific use case. We have also found some basic optimisations that we can apply to our code, specifically around parallelism. Finally, we introduced the Spark UI, which is an important tool in debugging and improving the performance of your applications. "
